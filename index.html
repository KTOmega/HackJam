	<h4>What is HackJam?</h4>
        <div class="medium-6 large-8 columns">
For our 9th consecutive semester, there's a jam at Berkeley coming up. No, it's not a traffic jam. Welcome to HackJam: Talent. Prizes. Mentorship. Refreshments. All jammed into 4000 square feet of awesome.<br><br>

At HackJam, hackers of all levels of experience get together for twelve hours of hacking and snacking. No pressure, we're all here to learn. We'll be running introductory workshops and 1:1 mentorship for those of you new to hacking; we'll have hardware and APIs for those who want to branch out into something new.<br><br>

There will be friendship. There will be prizes. Come to HackJam - it's gonna be pretty sweet.

          <h4>FAQ</h4>
<strong>Do I need to register or apply to attend HackJam?</strong> <br>
Yes! Register <a href="https://bit.ly/hackjamreg">here</a>. Registration is non-competitive - we'll use this information for logistics and making the event <em>~hella baller~</em>. <br><br>

<strong>What if I show up without registering?</strong><br>
No food for you (because we'll have ordered food without knowing you'll be there). Seriously please register. It really helps us out :)<br><br>

<strong>Do I need to be a Berkeley student?</strong><br>
Nope! Please be a student somewhere, though (both community college and high school are chill). If you're a non-student who wants to come, consider mentoring!<br><br>

<strong>What if I'm in high school? Do I need to do anything special?</strong><br>
Nope, just come! We're not overnight so you don't need to fill out a form.<br><br>

<strong>What if I'm inexperienced / have no idea what I'm doing?</strong><br>
We'll have mentorship, brainstorming workshops, and fellow-hacker meetups to help you get going. We're here for you. HackJam isn't competitive.<br><br>

<strong>Isn't this is on Parents' Weekend?</strong><br>
hack with your parents lol<br><br>

<strong>I have another question?</strong><br>
That's not a question, but message us and we'll get back to you.<br><br>
